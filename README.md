# CORD-FACTOR-FORMULA
THE CORE FORMULA  FOR THE BUILDING OF GEODESIC DOMES
The purpose of this project is to make incompusing coads for geodesic structors. based on the five pathageron solids, tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodeciahedron, icosahedron.
I have three volums of forumilas that relate geodesic math and my intention is to get something even I can use. I say that because at this time I am an addmited novis in the programing of JAVA but with enough time I will get it. If people want  to join in I thank you in advance for the help and interest.
